# Thx
Thx is the **best way** to say Thank You ðŸ’–

// To be recreated in School Tool
// Was originally planned to use Power Automate Web Hooks
## What is Thx?
Have you ever wanted to drop in **a quick Thank-You** but **aren't sure** how to make it as **quick** and **easy** as possible?

Do you want to thank someone from the **bottom of your heart** and make your thank you as **memorable** as possible? 

### Welcome to Thx.
Here at AcroFord, we wanted to make a solution that was:
- Intuitive
- Easy to use
- Efficient
- On the cutting edge

And we came up with Thx.

## How does Thx work?
So a student / teacher wants to **make someone's day**, how do they do that? **Thx**!
- They create a Thx.
- We use **advanced AI** to appropriately moderate
- Our servers get the response and we generate a draft Thx.
